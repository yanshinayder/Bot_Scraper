# Bot_Scraper
### For this project I used the Python 3.9 version
### First we need to create our Discord Bot www.discord.com, and choose the developer option.
### Once created, we'll configure it to give you the permissions we find necessary.

### With the settings made we will take our TOKEN for the project that is in the BOT Tab.

# Warning
### It is not recommended to leave your TOKEN in code, I recommend using getenv to import this token from a variable.
* In my case I left an expired token as a sample for comparations if the requested Token is right.

### Done that we just need to do our Bot code and our scraper code, importing it into our bot at the end.
### In this project I used the runpee.com site to scrape the data on the main movie news, only with the $search command on my Discord channel.
